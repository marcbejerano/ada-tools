Ada tools and libraries

## Properties

The Properties project provides a simple library for the manipulation of
properties files generated by Java and in the standard format of name=value.
Comments, output to XML, and the idosyncracies of the Java properties
storage model are all supported.

The following snippet is from the Oracle page on [java.util.Properties](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/Properties.html) and is indicative on what the properties file should look like. There is also some experimental support for saving the properties in XML format (no loader yet).

```
# You are reading the ".properties" entry.
! The exclamation mark can also mark text as comments.
# The key and element characters #, !, =, and : are written with
# a preceding backslash to ensure that they are properly loaded.
website = http\://en.wikipedia.org/
language = English
# The backslash below tells the application to continue reading
# the value onto the next line.
message = Welcome to \
          Wikipedia\!
# Add spaces to the key
key\ with\ spaces = This is the value that could be looked up with the key "key with spaces".
# Unicode
tab : \u0009
```

## Logging

The Logging project provides for a log4j-like logging solution for Ada. It is used mush the same as the Java counterpart.

For example:

```ada
with Logging.Logger;        use Logging.Logger;
with Logging.Level;         use Logging.Level;
with Logging.Event;         use Logging.Event;
with GNAT.Source_Info;

procedure LoggerTest is
    myLogger : Logger_Ptr;
begin
    Init_Logging("logger.properties");
    myLogger := Get_Logger("LoggerTest");

    myLogger.Warn ("This is a warning message");
    myLogger.Error(New_Log_Event("Error Message",
                           GNAT.Source_Info.File,
                           GNAT.Source_Info.Line));
end LoggerTest;
```

The logging system is configured using a standard properties file (hence the need for the Properties library)

```properties
rootLogger=ERROR,stdout
LoggerTest=DEBUG,stdout,file

appender.stdout=ConsoleAppender
appender.stdout.layout=%d{ISO8601} [%-5p] %m%n

appender.file=FileAppender
appender.file.filename=loggertest.log
appender.file.layout=%d{ISO8601} [%-5p] %F(%-4L) %m%n
```
*TODO:* Add cleanup on termination
